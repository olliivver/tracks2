# tracks
<h3>Welcome to tracks - v2!</h3>
<p>This site is a community accessibility project, the purpose of which is to keep track of the status of illegal train track crossings in MTL, Quebec.</p>
<p>Approximately 12,000 people use illegal train track crossings daily on their commute to and from work.</p>
<p>Since the early 2000's, the city and CN rail have been in a political deadlock over whether to build a pedestrian crossing, or a foot bridge.</p>
<p>Instead of either, the response has been to hand out $650 tickets, or shut the holes in the fence, to the detriment of commuters.</p>
<p>This project is intended to encourage political advocacy and promote action to build safe crossings for commuters.</p>
